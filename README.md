The Air Passenger Traffic Forecasting Problem
 : An airline company has the data on the 
number of passengers that have travelled with them on a particular route for the past few years. 
Using this data, they want to see if they can forecast the number of passengers for the next 
twelve months. 
Making this forecast could be quite beneficial to the company as it would help them take some 
crucial decisions like -  
1. What capacity aircraft should they use? 
2. When should they fly? 
3. How many air hostesses and pilots do they need? 
4. How much food should they stock in their inventory?

The models have been performed on an airline passenger traffic dataset. It has the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with the airline on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, they want to see if they can forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months. 
You have been briefed about the dataset and the problem statement in the previous session. 

Basic Steps for Forecasting 
For any forecasting problem, there are some basic steps that need to be in place. Let us look at 
the basic steps mentioned below. And these steps are similar to any data science problem. 
The basic steps involved in any forecasting problem are: 
1. Define the problem 
2. Collect the data 
3. Analyze the data 
4. Build and evaluate the forecast model
